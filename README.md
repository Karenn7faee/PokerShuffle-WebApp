## Contributing

The game was givin as an assignment in a progamming class at Université de Montréal.
Originally made in python with an IDE build by the university. Not having access to this tool anymore,
the visual aspects to the original code aren't functionnal anymore. This is my first React app
to learn about web-apps and TypeScript.

Any feedback is appreciated.
